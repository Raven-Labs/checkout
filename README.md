# Checkout program for Raven Labs
- major work in progress, nothing works as intended as of yet.


This program is intended for use as an e-commerce platform for Raven Labs Limited.

Currently we are using Stripe's checkout page, but this is intended to replace it once it is production ready.

## Eventual goals of this project are:
- Being able to track purchases
- Admin api and interface, to add/delete/update products and see purchases
- Ability to purchase products via Stripe, and possibly via Bitcoin/Monero (providing that UK crypto regulations aren't too crazy.)
- Ability to add custom optional features to product pages (eg: whether or not you want us to install sandboxed google apps on the phone you order)
- Notifications of purchases to store owner(s) via Matrix or E-Mail
- Notifications of shipment updates via Matrix or E-Mail
- Feedback form, possibly public reviews
- Sleek modern interface
